# Relive

Relive is a story sharing app that answers the question, 'how will your story be shared?' 

Our products, Re:Live, Re:Compose, and Re:Imagine, aim to learn how each and every person's story is told, 
for a story changes every time it is told.

Disrupting the 2018 NBCUniversal Hackathon in Miami, Fl, Relive aims to innovate the very way we all share.
How will your story be shared?
